// variable in Java script

//Declare const variable_name = value, and this value cannot be change later on
const facebookId = 1986744;

// facebookId = 5648738; //No yor cannot do this bcoz its declare as a const

//Declare let variable if we want to change its value later on
let fbUserEmail = "mithu@mit.io";

//Declare var is not commonly used by these days bcoz it has problem on block scope and functional scope
var fbAccountPass = "nothing";

//we can declare the variable name directly without giveing any data type, but dont use this. But its possible in JS
fbRecoverEmail = "mit@mit.io";

//We can change the value of
fbUserEmail = "anurag@mit.io";
fbAccountPass = "12345678";
fbRecoverEmail = "mit1@mit.io";

console.log(facebookId);
console.table([fbUserEmail, fbAccountPass, fbRecoverEmail]);
